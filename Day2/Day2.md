## Python Primitive Data Types

### String
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (`'` or `"`). They are used to represent text data.

```python
"Hello"[0]
print("Hello"[0])

"Hello"[4]
print("123" + "345")
```

#### Subscript
Subscripting allows you to access individual characters in a string using their index, like `my_string[0]` for the first character.

### Integer
Integers are whole numbers that can be both positive and negative. They are often used for counting or iteration.

```python

print(123 = 345)

```

#### Large Integers
Python automatically handles large integers, allowing for integer values that exceed the usual 32- or 64-bit size limitations.

```python

123_456_789

#Computers just ignores the "_" and interprets as 123456789 

```

### Float
Floats represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point. They are used for more precise numerical calculations.

```python

3.14159

```
#### Floating Point Number
Floating-point numbers in Python are approximations due to the limitations of binary representation, which can lead to rounding errors.

```python 

3141.59

```

### Boolean
Booleans represent the truth values `True` and `False`. They are often used for conditional statements and logic operations. There are no quotations for True or False in the code. Always begins with a Capital letter. Very oftenly used in the code.

```python

True
False

```

#### Type Error
A Type Error occurs when an operation is performed on an inappropriate data type, like trying to concatenate a string with an integer in Python.

### Type Checking
Type checking involves verifying the data types of variables before performing operations on them. This can be done statically before runtime or dynamically during execution.

### Type Conversion
Type conversion, also known as type casting, is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another, such as converting an integer to a string with Python's `str()` function.

### Mathematical Operations

```python 

3 + 5
7 - 4
3 * 2
6 / 3
2 ** 3

PEMDASLR

()  (Parentesis)
**  (Exponents)
* / (Multiplication and Division)
+ - (Addition and Subtraction)

print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)



print (6 / 3)

print(type(6 / 3)) #Insert Type to check the type of data type)

# In Python, in division it always gives a float.

print(2 ** 3)

```
